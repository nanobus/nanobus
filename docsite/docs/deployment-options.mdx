    driver = "docker"
    config {
      image = "nanobus/nanobus:latest"
      args = ["run","<OCI Package Reference or Path to bus.yaml>"]
    }

    ports {
        http = 8080
    }

    resources {
      cpu = 100
      memory = 128
    }
  }
}
```

        config {
            command = "/path/to/nanobus"
            args = ["run", "<OCI Package Reference or Path to bus.yaml>"]
