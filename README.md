![NanoBus Logo](https://github.com/nanobus/nanobus/blob/main/docs/images/nanobus-logo.svg)

NanoBus is a lightweight application runtime that reduces developer responsibility so that teams can **focus on core logic**.

For detailed information see the [overview](./docs/overview.md) and [architecture](./docs/architecture.md) pages.

## Install

**Linux** - Install from Terminal to `/usr/local/bin`:

```shell
wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nanobus/nanobus/main/install/install.sh -O - | /bin/bash
```

**MacOS** - Install from Terminal to `/usr/local/bin`:

```shell
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nanobus/nanobus/main/install/install.sh | /bin/bash
```

**Windows** - Install from Command Prompt:

```shell
powershell -Command "iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nanobus/nanobus/main/install/install.ps1 | iex"
```

> **Note**: Updates to PATH might not be visible until you restart your terminal application.

**Manually** - Select your architecture from [releases](https://github.com/nanobus/nanobus/releases).

## Create a simple application

Create a file called `bus.yaml` with the following contents:

```yaml
id: hello-world
version: 0.0.1
interfaces:
  Greeter:
    sayHello:
      steps:
        - name: Return greeting message
          # expr will evaluate a value and assign it
          # to the output of this pipeline.
          uses: expr
          with:
            # $ or pipe represent the input data
            # for this step.
            value: '"Hello, " + $.name'
```

Then run this command from your terminal:

```shell
echo '{"name": "World!"}' | nanobus invoke Greeter::sayHello
```

This should return `Hello, World!` as a JSON string. The JSON data returned by NanoBus applications can be piped to other utilities such as [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/).
